# Project: Calculator
---
A fully functional calculator built using HTML, CSS and Javascript in response to the challenge set in [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/calculator) WebDevelopment 101 course.

As set out in the course instruction:

> there are elements of this project that are not going to be trivially easy for you, but if youâ€™ve been following the course so far you definitely have everything you need to finish it.

## Future Development
- Keyboard support 
- Responsive design

##Tidbits
- Don't forget to look for Easter eggs! I wonder what happens when you make Pi...
