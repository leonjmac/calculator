# Project: Calculator
A fully functional calculator built using HTML, CSS and Javascript in response to the challenge set in [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/calculator) WebDevelopment 101 course. Feel free to inspect the source code!

As set out in the course instruction:

> there are elements of this project that are not going to be trivially easy for you, but if youâ€™ve been following the course so far you definitely have everything you need to finish it.

And having completed the project (along with most of the optional tasks), I can certainly attest that this was the case! :) Making sure that a decimal was preceed by a '0' if no other numbers had been entered was fun as was handling the operators!!

## Functionality

Current version includes most basic calculator tasks such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and calculating a percentage in a responsively designed manner.

Keyboard entry is supported in this initial version.

## Future Development
- Scientific mode!
